== Description

This is a implementation of the GOST 28147-89 - a Soviet and Russian government standard symmetric key block cipher (now as part of standard https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuznyechik[GOST R 34.12-2015]).
GOST 28147-89 has a 64-bit blocksize and 256-bit keysize.

This implementation provide trade off size and performance. The goal was to be able to fit in to a low cost Xilinx Spartan series FPGA and still be as fast as possible. As one can see from the implementation results below, this goal has been achieved.

=== Short Chipher Detail


|===============================================
| *Date published* | 1989
| *Structure*      | Feistel network
| *Key sizes*      | 256 bits
| *Block sizes*    | 64 bits
| *Rounds*         | 32
|===============================================

== Features

* SystemVerilog RTL and TB code is provided
* Implements both encryption and decryption in the same block
* GOST 28147-89 algorithm focusing on very low area applications
* Implementation takes about 32 cycles to encrypt/decrypt a block
* EBC-cipher mode support
* The core complies to use of S-box according to RFC4357/GOST R34.11-94 or RFC5830 (by synthesis), or S-box switch "on the fly" (realtime).

== Status

* Core implementations have been tested on a Xilinx Spartan-3E FPGA succesfully

== Employment

For run synthesize design using Synplify tool use command:

  $ make synthesis

To compile and run simulation RTL-design using ModelSim with CLI:

  $ make sim

To compile and run simulation RTL-design using ModelSim with GUI:

  $ make sim-gui

In order to determine which S-box will be used for synthesis/simulation you must to pass apropriate define by command line argument:

* `GOST_R_3411_TESTPARAM` - for RFC4357 S-box using
* `GOST_R_3411_CRYPTOPRO` - for RFC5830 S-box using
* `GOST_R_3411_BOTH`      - both RFC4357 and RFC5830 S-boxes using with switching "on the fly"


All procedures like synthesis or simulation was tested on the Linux environment (x86_64 host).

=== Synthesis

Sample Synthesis Results for the ECB-mode GOST 28147-89

```
Technology 	       Size/Area 	Speed/Performance
==============================================================
Xilinx Spartan-3E      525 LUTs         75 Mhz (150 Mbits/sec)
```


== Limitations

The design uses SystemVerilog as language for RTL-implementation therefore your Design Tools should support SystemVerilog for synthesis and simulation.
